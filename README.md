### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="50"> A little more about me...  

I've been working in the software industry for 16 years (since 2008), building and scaling web and mobile applications. 

âœ¨ In 2015, I co-founded Conpass, a SaaS startup focused on user onboarding, where I was the sole developer in the early stages, building the product from scratch. As the company grew, I hired and led a team of 4-6 developers and 1 designer, ensuring a robust, scalable, and high-performance platform. Conpass was later acquired after impacting over 3 million users in 1,000+ companies.

Since 2019, I have been working as a consultant and freelancer, helping startups and lean teams scale their products and infrastructure. I specialize in full-stack development, software architecture, API integrations, automation, and cloud computing, working with companies across different industries like SaaS, fintech, e-commerce, and AI-driven platforms.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments and enjoy collaborating with teams that value clean code, strong engineering practices, and a user-first mindset. My entrepreneurial background and hands-on experience allow me to deliver scalable and high-impact solutions that align with business goals.

ðŸ”­ I'm passionate about AI, automation, and user engagement strategies. Always open to exciting projects, global opportunities, and connecting with like-minded professionals!
