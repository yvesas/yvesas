# Hi, I'm Yves! `<img src="assets/emojis/WavingHandMediumLightSkinTone.png" width="29px">`

### `<img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1531849430/4246/blob-sunglasses.gif?1531849430" width="30"/>` A little more about me...

I've been working in the software industry for **16 years** (since 2008), building and scaling web and mobile applications.

✨ In 2015, **I co-founded Conpass**, a SaaS startup focused on user onboarding, where I was the sole developer in the early stages, building the product from scratch. As the company grew, I hired and led a team of 4-6 developers and 1 designer, ensuring a robust, scalable, and high-performance platform. **Conpass was later acquired after impacting over 3 million users in 1,000+ companies.**

🌱 Since 2019, I have been working as a consultant and freelancer, helping startups and lean teams scale their products and infrastructure. Working with companies across different industries like SaaS, fintech, e-commerce, and AI-driven platforms.

### 🔹 I specialize in:

- Full-stack development;
- Software architecture;
- API integrations;
- Automation;
- Cloud computing.

I thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments and enjoy collaborating with teams that value clean code, strong engineering practices, and a user-first mindset. My entrepreneurial background and hands-on experience allow me to deliver scalable and high-impact solutions that align with business goals.

😄 I'm passionate about AI, automation, and user engagement strategies. Always open to exciting projects, global opportunities, and connecting with like-minded professionals!
